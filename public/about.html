<p>Hello! I'm a junior web developer with a unique and diverse background. My journey into web development started with a deep realization during my master's program in Development Studies, which I pursued for almost two years. Although I initially wanted to do this course, an internship in Frankfurt revealed that something was not adding up. I couldn't connect with the work as I had hoped, leading me to reassess my career path.</p>

<p>As a student in Germany, I faced a significant challenge: quitting my master's program would mean losing my immigration status. Determined to find a solution, I consulted an immigration lawyer, despite the financial strain of an unpaid internship. The lawyer advised against quitting school but suggested exploring IT, a field with a high demand for workers.</p>

<p>Inspired, I embarked on a quest to transition into IT. A serendipitous encounter with a YouTube video by Tim Kim, a college dropout turned software developer, ignited my excitement. His clear guidance on becoming a software developer in just four months was exactly what I needed. Motivated, I dived onto social media to connect with others who had made similar transitions, drawing inspiration and practical advice from their experiences.</p>

<p>Today, I'm passionate about web development and committed to honing my skills in this dynamic field. In my free time, I enjoy traveling, trying new dishes, and watch documentaries. I'm eager to connect with fellow web developers and others navigating career changes. Let's build something amazing together!</p>
